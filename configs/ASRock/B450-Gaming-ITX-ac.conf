chip "nct6792-isa-0290"

    # Voltages
    # Given https://hwmon.wiki.kernel.org/voltagelabelsandscaling the chip
    # readings limits goes from 0 to 2.04
    # Given the same source, 1bit = 8mV
    ignore in1 # Always reads 0
    ignore in2 # Reading above the chip limit
    ignore in3 # Reading above the chip limit
    ignore in4 # Always reads 0
    ignore in5 # Always reads 0
    ignore in7 # Reading above the chip limit
    ignore in8 # Reading above the chip limit
    ignore in10 # Standard deviation is 0
    ignore in14 # Always reads 0

    # Fans (Labels as found on the BIOS)
    label fan1 "Chassis Fan 1"
    label fan2 "CPU Fan 1"

    # Temperatures
    ignore temp1 # Having a value over 100, and not moving that much when heating the MB with an hair-dryer for 2 minutes
    ignore temp2 # Negative reading
    label temp3 "M/B" # Guessing (That's the last "realistic" value we have)
    ignore temp4 # Having a value over 100, and not moving that much when heating the MB with an hair-dryer for 2 minutes
    ignore temp5 # Having a value over 100, and not moving that much when heating the MB with an hair-dryer for 2 minutes
    ignore temp6 # Negative reading
    label temp7 "CPU" # Guessing (Seems to change accordingly to the CPU load, and the heat I measured "by hand" on the heatsink)
    ignore temp8 # Always reads 0
    ignore temp9 # Always reads 0
    ignore temp10 # Always reads 0
